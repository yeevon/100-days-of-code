# Mail Merge â€“ Personalized Letter Generator
## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project automates the process of generating personalized invitation letters by merging names from a list into a templated letter. The output is saved as individual text files, ready to send.

-----------

### ðŸ§  Features
- Reads a list of names from invited_names.txt.

- Loads a letter template from starting_letter.txt.

- Replaces the placeholder [name] in the template with each actual name.

- Saves the personalized letters to the Output/ReadyToSend/ directory.

2. [name] in the template is replaced with the actual name.

3. A new file is written for each invite in the ReadyToSend folder.
