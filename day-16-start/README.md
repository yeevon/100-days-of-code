# Day 16 â€“ Climbing Stairs (Dynamic Programming)
## ğŸ“˜ Overview
Implemented a solution to the classic "Climbing Stairs" problem using dynamic programming. The problem asks: In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top of a staircase with n steps, if you can take 1 or 2 steps at a time?

## ğŸ§  What I Learned
- Used bottom-up dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations.

- Built the solution iteratively using a list to store intermediate results.

- Improved performance over recursive or naive approaches.

## ğŸ§ª Sample Code
```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        x = [1, 1]
        for i in range(1, n):
            x.append(x[i-1] + x[i])
        return x[-1]
```
